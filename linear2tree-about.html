        This is a small linguistics typesetting utility to help
	people who write linguistics papers and are in need of typesetting
	parse trees.
	<br><br>
	
	I myself was one of those people and tried to draw trees using
	drawing software which took much time and did not produce high
	quality output.
	<br><br>

	However, later I realized that a linear representation of a parse
	tree such as:
	<br><br>

	[PP [Spec right] [P' [P across] [NP [Spec the] [N' [N bridge]]]]]
	<br><br>

	can be automatically translated to the traditional two dimensional
	tree form and included in a paper.
	<br><br>

	So I wrote a small program using Common Lisp programming language
	hoping it can help the linguistic research community and ease
	their job writing and typesetting beautiful papers.
	<br><br>

	To try the utility visit <u>"Try the program"</u> section.
	<br><br>

	The current shortcomings of program:

	 <ul>
	 <li>It doesn't produce .pdf output.</li>
	 <li>It is tested only for Turkish and English alphabet.</li>
	 <li>The Turkish character set is only handled correctly for .png output.
	    (due to some PostScript font problems).</li>
	 <li>There are no ways to adjust the size and other parameters of the output.</li>
	 </ul>
